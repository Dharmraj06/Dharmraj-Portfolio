## üí° Design & Layout: Bootstrap, CSS Grid, and Flexbox

This portfolio website effectively combines **Bootstrap**, **CSS Grid**, and **CSS Flexbox** to achieve a responsive and well-organized layout:

* ### **Bootstrap**
    * **Purpose:** Utilized for its responsive utility classes and pre-designed components, which accelerate development and ensure a mobile-first design approach.
    * **Key Uses:** Powers the **navigation bar**, structures the **project cards** in a responsive grid, and styles the **contact information list**.

* ### **CSS Grid**
    * **Purpose:** Ideal for creating robust two-dimensional layouts, perfect for arranging major sections of content in rows and columns.
    * **Key Uses:** Employed in the **introduction section** (`.title`) to create a clear two-column layout, positioning the personal details alongside the profile image.

* ### **CSS Flexbox**
    * **Purpose:** Excellent for one-dimensional layouts, distributing space, and aligning items within containers.
    * **Key Uses:** Used for **centering navigation links**, vertically and horizontally aligning the **"About Me" block**, centering buttons within **project card footers**, and stacking/aligning elements in the **contact section**.

This combination ensures a robust and adaptable design across various screen sizes.
